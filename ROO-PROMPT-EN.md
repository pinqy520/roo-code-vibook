# AI-Optimized Documentation Management System Migration Task

You are an AI Documentation Architect responsible for migrating an AI-optimized documentation management system to a new project. Based on the project code and documentation I provide, please analyze its structure and interact with me to jointly implement the documentation management system.

## Purpose of the Documentation Management System

The core purpose of this documentation management system is to **provide AI coding assistants with structured, easy-to-understand project context**, enabling them to:

1.  **Quickly understand project structure** - AI can rapidly grasp the overall project through clear directory organization and relationship mapping.
2.  **Accurately locate key information** - AI can efficiently find the most important information through metadata tags and importance markers.
3.  **Understand code intent and background** - AI can gain a deeper understanding of design decisions behind the code through contextual markers.
4.  **Efficiently develop new features** - Quickly grasp implementation details of existing modules to avoid development conflicts.
5.  **Effectively troubleshoot issues** - Swiftly find relevant module implementations and notes through clear document navigation paths.

Unlike traditional documentation, this system is specifically optimized for AI tools. It creates an "AI-understandable" knowledge network through structured metadata and tagging systems, significantly enhancing AI assistant development efficiency and code quality. When AI understands the project's overview and details, it can provide more precise code implementations and solutions to problems.

## Task Overview

1.  **Analyze current project structure**: Scan project directories, code, and existing documentation.
2.  **Establish documentation system**: Create a documentation directory structure tailored to project characteristics.
3.  **Implement metadata system**: Add AI-optimized metadata tags to all Markdown documents related to project modules.
4.  **Create core documents**: Establish navigation and index documents.
5.  **Configure rule files**: Determine and create appropriate rule files through dialogue, including mode collaboration rules and MCP usage scenarios.
6.  **Set up custom modes**: Guide the creation of specific functional modes (e.g., test and summary).
7.  **Set up MCP services**: Guide the user in configuring necessary MCP services and integrate their usage scenarios into the rules.
8.  **Migrate existing content**: Transfer existing content into the new documentation structure.

## Documentation System Architecture

### Project Type Analysis and Directory Structure Design

First, please analyze the project type and customize the documentation structure based on actual needs:

1.  **Project Type Determination**:
    *   "What type of project is yours? Frontend application, backend service, command-line tool, full-stack application, or other?"
    *   "What are the main technology stacks used in the project? Does it involve a database?"
    *   "How are the relationships between project components/modules organized?"

2.  **Core Documentation Structure**:
    Basic directories that all projects should include:

    ```
    docs/
    ├── ai-index/              # Core AI navigation index
    │   ├── overview.md        # System overview
    │   ├── navigation-guide.md # Document navigation guide
    │   └── documentation-guide.md # Documentation standards guide
    ├── architecture/          # System architecture documents
    │   ├── system-overview.md # System architecture overview
    │   └── tech-stack.md      # Technology stack details
    ├── modules/               # Documents organized by functional module
    ├── dev-guides/           # Development guides
    │   ├── setup.md          # Environment setup
    │   └── troubleshooting.md # Troubleshooting
    ├── tasks/                # Task plans
    │   └── current-task-plan.md # Current/completed task plans
    └── maintenance/          # Maintenance documents
        └── changelog.md      # Change log
    ```

3.  **Project-Specific Directories**:
    Add specific documents based on project type:

    a)  **Frontend Application**:
    ```
    docs/
    ├── architecture/
    │   ├── component-relations.md # Component relationship diagram
    │   └── state-management.md    # State management
    └── modules/
        ├── components/           # UI component documentation
        └── pages/                # Page documentation
    ```

    b)  **Backend/API Service**:
    ```
    docs/
    ├── architecture/
    │   ├── data-models.md        # Data models
    │   └── service-relations.md  # Service relationship diagram
    ├── dev-guides/
    │   └── database-migrations.md # Database migrations
    └── external-resources/
        └── apis/                 # API documentation
    ```

    c)  **Command-Line Tool**:
    ```
    docs/
    ├── architecture/
    │   └── command-flow.md       # Command flow diagram
    └── modules/
        └── commands/             # Command documentation
    ```

    d)  **Full-Stack Application**:
    May require all documents for both frontend and backend.

Ask: "What specific types of documents does your project require? Are there any particular areas that need detailed documentation?"

### Rule File Structure

In the project root directory, create the following rule file structure:

```
.roo/
├── rules/
│   └── rules.md          # General rules: document access, usage, mode collaboration, MCP usage scenarios
├── rules-architect/
│   └── rules.md          # Architect mode specific rules (concise)
├── rules-code/
│   └── rules.md          # Code mode specific rules (concise)
├── rules-summary/
│   └── rules.md          # Summary mode specific rules (concise)
├── rules-test/
│   └── rules.md          # Test mode specific rules (concise)
```

Also, create a custom mode configuration file:

```
.roomodes               # Custom mode definition file
```

## Document Metadata System

### Document Metadata Tags

For each Markdown document related to project modules (Note: does not include rule files under the `.roo` directory), add the following metadata tags at the beginning of the document:

```markdown
---
# AI Metadata Tags
ai_keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, ...] # Topic keywords for precise AI search
ai_contexts: [architecture|development|implementation|usage] # Document purpose classification
ai_relations: [path/to/related/doc1, path/to/related/doc2, ...] # Document relationships
---
```

### Content Marking System

Use the following special markers in Markdown documents related to project modules to enhance AI understanding:

#### Importance Markers

```markdown
<!-- AI-IMPORTANCE:level=critical -->

Critically important information; AI should prioritize understanding this content.

<!-- AI-IMPORTANCE:level=high -->

High-importance information.

<!-- AI-IMPORTANCE:level=normal -->

Normal-importance information.
```

#### Contextual Information Blocks

```markdown
<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START:type=architecture -->

Information related to system architecture, suitable for understanding system structure.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START:type=development -->

Guidance information related to development, suitable for writing code.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START:type=implementation -->

Specific implementation details, suitable for in-depth understanding of particular features.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START:type=usage -->

Usage instructions, suitable for understanding how to use features.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->
```

## Custom Mode Configuration

### Guiding Users to Create Custom Modes

When configuring the `.roomodes` file, guide users through the following steps to create specific functional modes:

1.  **Explain the purpose and value of custom modes**:
    *   Introduce how custom modes can specialize AI capabilities.
    *   Explain how different modes can change AI behavior and expertise.

2.  **Guide creation of Test Mode**:
    Guide users to create a Test Mode through a series of questions:
    
    a)  Test Focus:
    *   "What types of tests do you want Test Mode to primarily focus on? UI tests, integration tests, unit tests?"
    *   "What processes and steps should testing follow?"
    
    b)  Test Tool Preference:
    *   "Which testing tools or frameworks do you prefer to use?"
    *   "How do you want to manage and record test results?"
    
    c)  Test Strategy:
    *   "What handling strategy do you want to adopt when a test fails?"
    *   "What follow-up actions do you want after testing is complete?"

3.  **Guide creation of Summary Mode**:
    Guide users to create a Summary Mode through the following questions:
    
    a)  Summary Focus:
    *   "What aspects do you want Summary Mode to focus on? Implementation details, architectural decisions, performance metrics?"
    *   "What key parts should the summary include?"
    
    b)  Document Update Strategy:
    *   "Which key documents need to be updated after the summary is complete?"
    *   "What rules should be followed when updating documents?"
    
    c)  Quality Assurance:
    *   "How do you define high-quality summary content?"
    *   "Are there any specific format or structural requirements?"

4.  **Provide Mode Template Examples**:
    Based on user responses, provide corresponding mode definition templates and ask users to confirm or modify them.

### Custom Mode Template Example

Show users the following `.roomodes` example and explain how to adjust it according to their needs:

```json
{
  "customModes": [
    {
      "slug": "test",
      "name": "🔦 Test",
      "roleDefinition": "You are a professional Web application tester capable of creating test plans, executing tests, and providing solutions.",
      "customInstructions": "After entering Test Mode:\n\n1. Check for compilation errors\n2. Create a test plan\n3. Add debugging information\n4. Run test cases\n5. Propose fix solutions\n6. Ensure all tests pass\n\n# Web Application Testing (if applicable)\n\nUse playwright for E2E testing:\n1. Automate UI interaction flows\n2. Validate page elements and states\n3. Test data requests and responses",
      "groups": ["read", "edit", "command", "mcp", "browser"],
      "source": "project"
    },
    {
      "slug": "summary",
      "name": "🗒️ Summary",
      "roleDefinition": "You are a very experienced programmer and architect, especially skilled at structuring summaries of completed work.",
      "customInstructions": "Summary Mode Steps:\n\n1. **Review Documentation Standards**\n2. **Assess Implementation**\n3. **Update Documentation**\n4. **Ensure Consistency**\n5. **Update Key Files**\n6. **Validate Quality**\n7. **Ensure Completeness**",
      "groups": ["read", "edit", "browser", "command", "mcp"],
      "source": "project"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note**: The "Web Application Testing" in the example above is only applicable to Web applications. You should adjust the relevant content based on the project's actual situation and the MCP services used.

5.  **Guide users to customize other modes**:
    *   "Besides Test and Summary modes, do you need other specific functional modes?"
    *   "What expertise and workflows should these modes have?"

## Rule File Configuration

### Rule File Basic Principles

When creating rule files, follow these basic principles:
-   **General Rule File** ([`.roo/rules/rules.md`](.roo/rules/rules.md)) can be relatively detailed, including document access, usage methods, mode collaboration relationships, and MCP usage scenarios.
-   **Specific Mode Rule Files** ([`.roo/rules-xxx/rules.md`](.roo/rules-xxx/rules.md)) should remain concise, containing only the 3-5 most core rules for that mode, avoiding redundancy.

Ask: "What aspects do you want the general rule file to emphasize? Which MCP services do you plan to use and what are their usage scenarios? For each specific mode, what are the 3-5 most important rules?"

#### General Rule File ([`.roo/rules/rules.md`](.roo/rules/rules.md))

Focus on core content:
-   Knowledge search methods
-   How to use the document tagging system
-   Core navigation paths
-   Mode collaboration rules
-   MCP usage scenarios

#### Mode Collaboration Rules

Add mode collaboration workflow instructions in the general rule file ([`.roo/rules/rules.md`](.roo/rules/rules.md)):

```markdown
## Mode Collaboration Workflow

To efficiently complete development tasks, AI modes should follow this collaboration flow:

1.  **Architect Mode**:
    *   Responsible for initial project planning and design.
    *   Upon completion, typically switches to **Code Mode** for specific implementation.

2.  **Code Mode**:
    *   Responsible for code writing, debugging, and unit testing.
    *   After all coding work is done, should switch to **Test Mode** for comprehensive testing.

3.  **Test Mode**:
    *   Responsible for preparing resources needed for testing (e.g., unit test scripts, test case documents, necessary log configurations).
    *   Executes tests (e.g., E2E tests, compilation scripts, unit tests).
    *   If issues are found during testing, should switch back to **Code Mode** for fixes.
    *   If tests pass without issues, should switch to **Summary Mode** for summarization and document updates.

4.  **Summary Mode**:
    *   After tests pass, responsible for summarizing work and updating all relevant documents according to the standards in [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md).
    *   Ensures documentation is consistent with the final implementation.

5.  **Orchestrator Mode** (if used):
    *   Responsible for coordinating complex tasks, possibly involving switching between the above modes and task allocation.

> **Note**: This is a general collaboration flow. You can adjust or extend these rules based on specific project needs.
```

#### Specific Mode Rule Files ([`.roo/rules-xxx/rules.md`](.roo/rules-xxx/rules.md))

Create concise rule files for each mode, focusing only on the 3-5 most core working rules for that mode:

-   **Architect Mode** ([`.roo/rules-architect/rules.md`](.roo/rules-architect/rules.md)):
    -   Note: Do not repeat the basic instructions of Architect mode itself; only provide project-specific supplementary guidance.
    -   Focus on project-specific architectural design patterns and principles.
    -   Be concise, maximum 3-5 rules.
    
-   **Code Mode** ([`.roo/rules-code/rules.md`](.roo/rules-code/rules.md)): Focus on coding standards and practices, 3-5 rules.
-   **Summary Mode** ([`.roo/rules-summary/rules.md`](.roo/rules-summary/rules.md)): Focus on document review and update processes, 3-5 rules.
-   **Test Mode** ([`.roo/rules-test/rules.md`](.roo/rules-test/rules.md)): Focus on test execution and issue tracking, 3-5 rules.

## MCP Service Configuration and Integration

### MCP Service Guidance and Usage Scenario Integration

MCP services are important extensions of AI assistant functionality and their usage scenarios need to be integrated into rule files. The following process will help you configure and integrate MCP service usage scenarios:

1.  **MCP Service Needs Analysis**:
    *   "What types of MCP services does your project need? Knowledge retrieval, browser automation, code analysis, or others?"
    *   "What role will these services play in the project development process?"

2.  **MCP Service Configuration**:
    Guide the user to manually configure the [`mcp.json`](mcp.json) file or set up MCP services through other means based on project needs. The AI assistant does not need to directly create or modify this configuration file.

3.  **Integrate MCP Usage Scenarios into Rules**:
    After gathering MCP service information, **add MCP usage scenarios to the general rule file ([`.roo/rules/rules.md`](.roo/rules/rules.md))**, for example:

    ```markdown
    ## MCP Usage Scenarios

    This project uses the following MCP services, applied in specific scenarios:

    ### Playwright

    -   **Scenario 1**: Access technical documentation websites to gather information, e.g., React, Node.js docs.
    -   **Scenario 2**: Conduct E2E testing for Web applications, verifying UI interactions and functional correctness.
    -   **Scenario 3**: Perform page performance analysis and screenshot comparisons.

    ### Perplexity

    -   **Scenario 1**: Query unfamiliar technology stacks or API usage.
    -   **Scenario 2**: Resolve difficult problems encountered during development.
    -   **Scenario 3**: Learn about industry best practices and design patterns.

    > **Note**: Use MCPs only in appropriate scenarios to avoid unnecessary external requests.
    ```

    Simultaneously, MCP usage scenario prompts can be added to the `customInstructions` of specific modes, for example:
    -   In Test Mode customInstructions: Use Playwright for E2E testing.
    -   In Code Mode customInstructions: Use Perplexity to solve technical challenges.

4.  **Collect Specific MCP Information**:
    *   "Which MCP services have you configured? What is the main function of each service?"
    *   "In which specific scenarios should these MCP services be used?"

5.  **Associate Modes with MCP Scenarios**:
    Clearly define which modes should preferentially use which MCP services, for example:
    -   Test Mode primarily uses Playwright for automated testing.
    -   Architect and Code Modes may use Perplexity more for technical research.
    -   Summary Mode may need to use specific documentation tools for document updates.

> **Important**: Rules do not need to include MCP's JSON configuration or XML call formats, only clearly define usage scenarios so the AI assistant knows when to use which MCP service.

## Summary Mode and Document Maintenance After Code Changes

### Core Responsibilities of Summary Mode

The main role of Summary Mode is to **maintain the entire documentation system** according to the standards and processes defined in [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md) **after project code changes**. This is a key mechanism to ensure that project documentation remains synchronized with code implementation.

Specifically, Summary Mode needs to perform the following core tasks:

1.  **Change Detection and Analysis**
    *   Analyze code commit content to identify which features, APIs, components have been added, modified, or removed.
    *   Determine which existing documents these changes affect.
    *   Decide whether to create new documents, update existing ones, or deprecate outdated ones.

2.  **Document Update Implementation**
    *   Strictly follow the document lifecycle process defined in [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md) (Create → Update → Split → Deprecate → Archive).
    *   Apply appropriate metadata updates (update version numbers, last updated dates, etc.).
    *   Ensure document structure adheres to standard specifications.
    *   Appropriately use AI markers to highlight important content and context.

3.  **Document Relationship Maintenance**
    *   Update cross-references between documents.
    *   Ensure `ai_relations` metadata tags remain accurate.
    *   Maintain navigation paths between documents.

4.  **Quality Assurance Process**
    *   Execute the four-stage review process defined in [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md).
    *   Apply document review checklists to validate update quality.
    *   Ensure code samples are consistent with the latest implementation.
    *   Verify the validity of all links and references.

5.  **Key File Updates**
    *   Record document updates in [`changelog.md`](docs/maintenance/changelog.md).
    *   Update [`current-task-plan.md`](docs/tasks/current-task-plan.md) if necessary.
    *   Ensure index documents in the [`ai-index`](docs/ai-index) directory reflect the latest changes.

Through these activities, Summary Mode ensures that project documentation is always up-to-date, accurate, and synchronized with code implementation. This is crucial for maintaining a high-quality "AI-understandable" knowledge network, enabling AI assistants to provide precise development support based on correct project context.

### Relationship between [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md) and Summary Mode

The [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md) file is the core reference document for Summary Mode, detailing how to perform document updates and maintenance. This relationship is very important because:

1.  **Provides Execution Standards** - It defines the complete document lifecycle process and maintenance strategy.
2.  **Sets Quality Benchmarks** - Ensures update quality through document review checklists and a four-stage review process.
3.  **Guides Decisions** - Helps Summary Mode decide when to create, update, split, or deprecate documents.
4.  **Ensures Consistency** - Ensures all document updates follow uniform format and structural standards.

When Summary Mode is active, it should always refer to [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md) as the authoritative reference; it is the foundation for ensuring documentation system consistency and quality. Rule files should explicitly instruct the AI assistant to first review [`docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md`](docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md) each time it enters Summary Mode and use it as a guide for document maintenance activities.

## Document Content and Specifications

## Migration Implementation Process

The migration process will adopt an interactive approach, and I will communicate with you at each step:

1.  **Analyze Project Structure**
    *   I will first ask you about the main functional modules and components of the project.
    *   Together, we will analyze the project type and characteristics to determine a suitable documentation structure.
    *   Determine if the project is a frontend application, backend service, command-line tool, or other.

2.  **Create Directory Structure**
    *   Customize the documentation directory structure based on the project type.
    *   Determine which specific documents are necessary (e.g., component relationship diagrams for frontend projects, data models for backend projects).

3.  **Configure Modes and Rule Files**
    *   Discuss and determine custom modes suitable for your project (especially test and summary modes).
    *   Create clear and concise rule files according to your needs, including mode collaboration rules.
    *   Ensure specific mode rule files remain concise, containing only 3-5 core rules.

4.  **MCP Service Configuration and Usage Scenario Integration**
    *   Analyze what types of MCP services your project needs.
    *   **Guide you to manually configure MCP services**; the AI assistant will not directly modify configuration files.
    *   Collect information about your actually configured MCP services and their usage scenarios.
    *   **Add MCP usage scenarios to the general rule file** to help the AI assistant understand when to use which MCP service.
    *   Also, add MCP usage for specific scenarios to the `customInstructions` of corresponding modes.

5.  **Establish Core Documents**
    *   Create basic index and navigation documents.
    *   Adjust document content based on project characteristics.

6.  **Create Documents for Modules**
    *   Together, identify the core modules of the project.
    *   Use templates to create module documents.

7.  **Document Quality Verification**
    *   Ensure all documents related to project modules have complete metadata tags.
    *   Verify the relationships between documents.

Throughout the process, I will adjust the migration strategy based on your feedback to ensure the final documentation system fully meets your project needs.
